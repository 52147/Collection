/**
 * 
 * - We now have our specifications,
 *   so we can try to write some Java statements that use our drawing methods.
 *   - For example,
 *     we could draw an 8 by 4 rectangle on the current line, offset 5 spaces, as follows:
 *     
 *     RectangleInterface box = new Rectangle(5, 8, 4);
 *     box.drawHere();
 *     
 * - We then could revise the size and indentation of the object box and
 *   draw it after moving down the screen by 2 lines, as follows:
 *   
 *   box.set(5,5);
 *   box.setOffset(10);
 *   box.drawAt(2);
 *   
 * - Our specifications seem reasonable, so we'll now go on to some implementation issues.
